                            Ehrhardt and her opponent, Republican 
                            Earnest Leonard, have been pounding the 
                            pavement to introduce themselves to 
                            voters in a re-drawn District 107, 
                            which includes the north em half of Oak 
                            Lawn, sections of cen- tral and east 
                            Dallas, and a northern swath east of 
                            central expressway jutting up to the LBJ 
                            Freeway. 
                            Ehrhardt has picked up the endorse ment of the 
                            political action committee of Lesbian/Gay 
                            Political Coalition of Dallas. 
                            Leonard received the endorse ment of 
                            Log Cabin Republicans of Dallas.

                            are kicking into high gear for election 
                            day. With statistics and maps of every 
                            square inch of the district, it seems, 
                            Ehrhardt plans to have an army measure. 
                            of about 30 "poll pushers" at voting

                            to remind people to vote and coordinate 
                            transportation to the polls. 
                            Ehrhardt said surprise its the most common

                            before, a situation which she said she 
                            finds frus- trating, given her efforts to 
                            get out in the district.

                            Gay and lesbian issues will almost certainly 
                            be featured in the 1997 legisla- gram tive
                            session. The Lesbian/Gay Rights Lobby of 
                            Texas plans to offer several proposals, 
                            as well as to fight off expect ed anti-gay bills:
                            Hate crimens. Both candidates for District 107 have 
                            pledged to support a hate crimes bill, 
                            which would stiffen criminal penalties 
                            for crimes motivated by religious, 
                            racial, or anti-gay preju- dice. Leonard 
                            said he generally sup- ports anti-crime 
                            measures. Ehrhardt is widely credited 
                            with being a leader in last session's 
                            attempt to pass a revised hate crimes 
                            bill, which narrowly failed in the House.

                    non-discrimination for his own staff. 
                    Ehrhardt supports the civil rights bill, 
                    arguing that employment security is one 
                    of the most important social justice 
                    questions facing the community. Observers 
                    say such a bill has no chance of passing 
                    during the Texas Legislature's next 
                    session.
                    ▮Same-gender marriage. Leonard has said 
                    he would vote for a bill ban- ning same-gender 
                    marriage in Texas. He said he sees no 
                    need to expand the family code to provide 
                    state recognition for same-gender unions.
                    Ehrhardt opposes the measure, which is 
                    expected to be introduced by anti-gay 
                    conserva- tives. Analysts expect a 
                    marriage bill forbidding same-gender 
                    unions to pass during the next 
                    legislative session. The question, 
                    they say, is how much anti- gay 
                    language will be included in the measure
                </p>
                <p class="pcinco">
                    ▮AIDS funding. Both candidates have said they 
                    support increased fund- ing for the AIDS 
                    Drug Assistance Program, which provides 
                    HIV medica- tions to low-income Texans, 
                    although Leonard stipulated that he would 
                    need to be convinced that the money was 
                    helping people and not "feeding the 
                    bureaucracy. Recent pharmaceutical 
                    advances, such as the protease inhibitors, 
                    have wildly escalated treat- ment costs 
                    and lobbyists say an addi- tional $14 
                    million will be needed from the state to 
                    fully fund the Texas progrm 
                    Given Ehrhardt's long history of involvement 
                    for gay and lesbian issues, many 
                    Democratic activists have expressed 
                    shock that the Log Cabin Republicans-Dallas 
                    have backed Leonard, endorsing the 
                    GOP candidate, hosting a fundraiser-reception 
                    for him and providing campaign volunteers.
                </p>
                <p class="pseis">
                    They [Log Cabin] really need to examine what 
                    their motivations are," said Peter 
                    Brooks, co-chair of the LGRI board. 
                    "If the Republicans control (the Texas 
                    House or Senate), we can kiss 
                    goodbye trying to get anything through."
                    Brooks said Ehrhardt had a 100 per 
                    Leonard opposes a gay civil rights 
                    bill cent voting record for gay 
                    issues, and to outlaw job discrimination 
                    against cited her assistance during the 
                    last ses- gays and lesbians, saying such 
                    mea sion and her persistence in lobbying 
                    Using jail time for rehabilitation sures 
                    inevitably lead to "frivolous law- other 
                    legislators to support the hate crimes
